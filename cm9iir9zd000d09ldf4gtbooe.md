## 🎥 Nail the Remote Interview

Most remote job interviews are virtual, and first impressions matter—even more when you're not in the same room.

### 💡 Tips for Success:

* **Test your tech** ahead of time: webcam, mic, and internet.
    
* Dress professionally and choose a clean, distraction-free background.
    
* Look into the camera, not the screen—it builds virtual eye contact.
    
* Prepare answers to questions like:
    
    * “How do you stay motivated when working from home?”
        
    * “What’s your approach to time management and productivity?”
