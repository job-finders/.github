# Introduction

Landing an interview is a big step—but **making a great impression during your first job interview** is what truly counts. For many South African graduates, this moment comes with anxiety, uncertainty, and plenty of “what ifs.”

At **JobFinders**, we’re here to help you walk into that room—or virtual call—**prepared, confident, and ready to stand out.**

---

## 🎯 1. Know What the Interview Is Really About

Employers don’t expect you to know everything. What they **want to see is potential, attitude, and readiness to learn**.

### ✅ What they’re really assessing:

* Your communication skills
    
* Your interest in the role/company
    
* Your cultural fit and attitude
    
* Basic understanding of the job
    

> 💡 *Example: A graduate applying for an admin role at a logistics company won the job not by knowing shipping software—but by showing interest in logistics, asking insightful questions, and communicating clearly.*

---

## 🔍 2. Research the Company (Even for Entry-Level Jobs)

**Don’t show up blind.** Employers love when candidates mention recent news, services, or values from their website or social media.

### 🧠 What to look for:

* What does the company do?
    
* Who are their clients or customers?
    
* What values or mission do they promote?
    
* Have they been in the news or posted recent projects?

## 🗣️ 3. Practice Common Interview Questions

Some questions are almost guaranteed. Practising your answers will help you stay calm and avoid awkward silences.

### 🔑 Common Questions:

1. “Tell me about yourself.”
    
2. “Why do you want to work here?”
    
3. “What are your strengths and weaknesses?”
    
4. “Where do you see yourself in five years?”
    
5. “Why should we hire you?”
    

> ✨ *Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) when answering questions about past experiences.*

---

## 👔 4. Dress Appropriately—Even for Virtual Interviews

Your appearance is part of the first impression. Always dress one level more formal than the expected dress code.

* **In-person?** Neat, clean, and modest is key.
    
* **Virtual?** Same rule applies—plus test your camera, lighting, and background.

## 📄 5. Bring the Right Documents

**Even if you submitted your CV online**, bring a printed copy. It shows professionalism.

### 📁 What to bring:

* 2 copies of your CV
    
* Certified copies of qualifications
    
* Your ID book/card
    
* A list of references
    
* Pen and notebook for notes or questions
    

---

## 💬 6. Ask Thoughtful Questions at the End

When they ask, *“Do you have any questions for us?”*, say more than “no.” This is your moment to show interest.

### Great questions to ask:

* “What does success look like in this role?”
    
* “What does a typical day look like?”
    
* “How would you describe the company culture?”
    

---

## 🧠 7. Reflect and Improve

After each interview, write down:

* What went well?
    
* What could you improve?
    
* What questions surprised you?
    

This reflection will make your next interview even better.
