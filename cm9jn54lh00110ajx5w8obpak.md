### 1\. **Start with a Clear, Professional Bio**

Your bio should summarize who you are, what you do, and the value you bring. Keep it short but impactful.

**Example:**

> "I‚Äôm a freelance graphic designer with 5+ years of experience helping startups and small businesses create strong visual identities. I specialize in logos, brand kits, and social media graphics."

**Tips:**

* Avoid jargon.
    
* Focus on results and skills.
    
* Use first-person to keep it personal.

### 2\. **Highlight Relevant Skills**

Platforms often let you tag your skills ‚Äî make sure you're strategic about this.

**Pro Tip:** Include both technical and soft skills. For example:

* Technical: Python, Adobe Illustrator, SEO

### 3\. **Add a Strong Profile Picture**

Yes, even for remote roles ‚Äî clients and employers want to know who they‚Äôre working with.
