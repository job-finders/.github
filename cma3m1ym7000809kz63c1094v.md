# Introduction

Landing your first job as a graduate in South Africa isn‚Äôt just about having the right qualifications‚Äîit‚Äôs about avoiding the subtle mistakes that could cost you the interview. At **JobFinders**, we‚Äôve worked with thousands of job seekers and employers across the country, and we‚Äôve seen promising applications fall flat for avoidable reasons.

This guide breaks down the **top mistakes new graduates make** during the job search process, and how to correct them with confidence.

---

## 1\. Applying Without Customising the Application

**Mass applying with the same CV and cover letter** rarely works. Employers want to see effort.

**Solution**: Tailor each application. Mention the company by name in your cover letter and align your skills with the job ad‚Äôs requirements. Tools like our [free job filter](https://jobfinders.site/) can help you target relevant roles.

---

## 2\. Ignoring the Importance of a Cover Letter

Many South African grads skip the cover letter, thinking it's optional. It‚Äôs not.

**Solution**: Write a short, focused letter (150‚Äì200 words) that tells the employer *why* you‚Äôre a good fit. Link it to their mission or the role‚Äôs impact. View examples in our blog‚Äôs [application toolkit](https://blog.jobfinders.site/).

## 3\. Leaving Out Contactable References

‚ÄúAvailable on request‚Äù doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore‚Äîespecially in a fast-paced hiring process.

**Solution**: Include at least **two references**, preferably from internships, lecturers, or volunteer supervisors. Always ask permission first.

---

## 4\. Not Researching the Company

Interviewers can tell when you haven‚Äôt done your homework. It‚Äôs a major turn-off.

**Solution**: Before the interview, spend 10 minutes on the company‚Äôs website or social media pages. Note recent news or projects and refer to them in your answers.

---

## 5\. Using Unprofessional Email Addresses

Emailing from ‚Äú[cutegirl2001@gmail.com](mailto:cutegirl2001@gmail.com)‚Äù might get your application binned‚Äîfast.

**Solution**: Create a new professional email using your name, e.g., [*thabiso.mokoena@gmail.com*](mailto:thabiso.mokoena@gmail.com).

---

## 6\. Ignoring LinkedIn and Online Presence

In 2025, not having a **digital footprint** is a red flag.

**Solution**: Build a basic LinkedIn profile with your education, skills, and interests. Share relevant articles or comment on industry trends‚Äîit shows initiative.

---

## 7\. Giving Up Too Soon

Rejection stings, especially when it‚Äôs your fifth or fiftieth ‚Äúno.‚Äù But **consistency beats talent in the long run**.

**Solution**: Set a daily or weekly job search routine. Use [JobFinders](https://jobfinders.site/) to track new postings, apply early, and follow up professionally after interviews.
